# e621-Discord-Bot
You need to be at least 18 years old to use this bot as it pulls images from a pornographic website.

The bot dynamically loads modules from the modules folder - you can add as many as you like, performing a wide variety of functions.

Currently all modules are commands designed to find furry images and videos on e621.net and embed them on Discord. Each command has multiple paramaters for finding more specific types of content.

The bot reacts to slash commands.
## Installation
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Make sure you have Python3 and pip installed
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the dependencies
4. In config.json add your Discord bot token (you can get one on the Discord Developer Portal in applications)
5. (Optional) Change the bot name in the config.json and main.py (by default it's "Bot_name") - this doesn't affect anything other than our OCD.
6. Run the main.py file (on Windows you can use start.bat file)
